(scrbook)              Note, that this option was already depreacted when
(scrbook)              it has been defined. Support for old font commands
(scrbook)              has been removed from KOMA-Script more than one
(scrbook)              decade ago. It is not recommended to use them any
(scrbook)              longer. Therefore usage of this class option also
(scrbook)              is not recommended.

Class scrbook Warning: deprecated old font command `\bf' used.

(scrbook)              new, combinable font commands. New KOMA-Script classes

(scrbook)              compatibility with LaTeX 2.09 document styles of
(scrbook)              Script 2.0. These commands are deprecated and
(scrbook)              undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013,
(scrbook)              KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of
(scrbook)              these deprecated commands. Now, after two decades of
(scrbook)              LaTeX2e, NFSS2, and KOMA-Script these commands will
